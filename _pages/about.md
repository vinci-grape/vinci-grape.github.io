**Xin Yin (殷鑫)** is the third-year Ph.D. student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), supervised by [Prof. Chao Ni](https://jacknichao.github.io/). I also obtained Bachelor’s degree at Central South University. 

My research interest includes **Large Language Model, Software Testing, and Software Security**. I have published papers at the top international conferences such as **FSE/ISSTA/ICSE/CVPR**. I developed a few well-known approaches including:
- [SVulD](https://github.com/vinci-grape/SVulD) and [MVulD](https://github.com/vinci-grape/MVulD): Vulnerability Detection
- [CodeGPTSensor+](https://github.com/vinci-grape/CodeGPTSensor-plus): LLM-generated Code Detection
- [ThinkRepair](https://github.com/vinci-grape/ThinkRepair): Program Repair
- [Rectifier](https://github.com/vinci-grape/Rectifier): Code Translation
- [AUGER](https://github.com/vinci-grape/AUGER) and [RATester](): Unit Test Generation

In 2025, I will lead or participate in the following research topics:
- Software Testing: Unit Test Generation
- Large Language Models (LLMs): Knowledge Editing
