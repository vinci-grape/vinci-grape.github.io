**Xin Yin (殷鑫)** is the fourth-year Ph.D. student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), supervised by [Prof. Chao Ni](https://jacknichao.github.io/). I also obtained Bachelor’s degree at [Central South University](https://en.csu.edu.cn/). I was grateful to intern or collaborate at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, ByteDance, Tongyi Lab, and MSRA. I was the core developer of the **Code Genesis** project in **MS-Agent (ModelScope Team, Tongyi Lab)** [![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/modelscope/ms-agent?style=social&label=Code+Stars)](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-agent). 

My research interest includes **Large Language Model, Software Testing, and Coding Agent**. I have published papers at the top international conferences such as **FSE/ISSTA/ICSE/ASE/CVPR/EMNLP/AAAI**. I developed a few well-known approaches including:
- [SVulD (FSE'23)](https://github.com/vinci-grape/SVulD) and [MVulD (TOSEM'25)](https://github.com/vinci-grape/MVulD): Vulnerability Detection
- [[1] (TSE'24)](https://github.com/vinci-grape/VulEmpirical) and [[2] (EMSE'25)](https://github.com/vinci-grape/Learning-based-Models-for-VD): Empirical Study of Vulnerability
- [CodeGPTSensor+](https://github.com/vinci-grape/CodeGPTSensor-plus): LLM-generated Code Detection
- [ThinkRepair (ISSTA'24)](https://github.com/vinci-grape/ThinkRepair) and [ReduceFix (ICSE'26)](): Program Repair
- [Rectifier](https://github.com/vinci-grape/Rectifier) and [RepoTransAgent](): Code Translation
- [AUGER (ICSE'25)](https://github.com/vinci-grape/AUGER), [RATester (ASE'25)](https://github.com/vinci-grape/RATester), [CasModaTest (ISSRE'25)](https://github.com/XiaoyaWang-gh/CasModa), and [JUnitGenie (ASE'25, ICSE'26 Demos)](https://github.com/Dianshu-Liao/JUnitGenie): Unit Test Generation
- [SolEval (EMNLP'25)](https://github.com/pzy2000/SolEval) and [PrefGen (ASE'25)](https://github.com/pzy2000/PrefGen): Smart Contract Generation
- [READ (CVPR'25)](https://github.com/rui-qian/READ) and [UGround](https://github.com/rui-qian/UGround): Reasoning Segmentation
- [SepPrune (AAAI'26)](): Speech Separation

In 2026, I will lead or participate in the following research topics:
- Software Testing: Unit Test Generation
- Large Language Models (LLMs): Coding Agent
