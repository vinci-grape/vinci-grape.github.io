**Xin Yin (ÊÆ∑Èë´)** is the second-year Ph.D. student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), supervised by [Prof. Chao Ni](https://jacknichao.github.io/). I also obtained Bachelor‚Äôs degree at Central South University. 

<!-- During my graduate study, I was lucky to collaborate with the CMU Speech Team led by [Prof. Shinji Watanabe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U5xRA6QAAAAJ), and Audio Research Team at Zhejiang University. I was grateful to intern or collaborate at TikTok, Shanghai AI Lab, Tencent Seattle Lab, Alibaba Qwen, with [Yi Ren](https://github.com/RayeRen), [Jinglin Liu](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver), [Chunlei Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NCKZGb0AAAAJ) and [Dong Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tMY31_gAAAAJ). -->

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->

My research interest includes **Software Testing, Software Security, and Software Analytics**. I have published papers at the top international conferences such as **FSE/ISSTA/ICSE**. I developed a few well-known approaches including:
- [SVulD](https://github.com/vinci-grape/SVulD) and [MVulD](https://github.com/vinci-grape/MVulD): vulnerability detection
- [ThinkRepair](https://github.com/vinci-grape/ThinkRepair): program repair
- [Rectifier](https://github.com/vinci-grape/Rectifier): code translation
- [AUGER](https://github.com/vinci-grape/AUGER): unit test generation
<!-- - AudioGPT, UniAudio, Make-A-Voice: Multitask, Multilingual LLMs -->
<!-- - Make-An-Audio, GenerSpeech: Zero-shot text-guided synthesis -->
<!-- - FastDiff 1/2, ProDiff: AIGC diffusion models -->
<!-- - TranSpeech, and AV-TranSpeech: Multimodal Translation -->

In 2024, I lead or participate in the following research topics:
- Software Testing: unit test generation
- Large Language Models (LLMs): knowledge editing
<!-- - Diffusion models: Image/Audio/3D -->
